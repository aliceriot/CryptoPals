#ex06: Break repeating-key XOR

So we built it last time, now we're going to work out how to defeat it.
Great stuff!

##How do?

Good question! OK so the challenge lays this out pretty nicely for us. We
need to solve for two things, essentially: first we need to figure out how
long the key is (keysize), and then we need to find out what each byte
looks like.
