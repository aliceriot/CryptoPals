#ex06: Break repeating-key XOR

So we built it last time, now we're going to work out how to defeat it.
Great stuff!

##How do?

Good question! OK so the challenge lays this out pretty nicely for us. We
need to solve for two things, essentially: first we need to figure out how
long the key is (keysize), and then we need to find out what each byte
looks like.

##Literate Python

I wrote an [explanation](literate_python/matasano_06.md) of my solution
using literate Python (the Pweave package). Check it out! I did a writeup
about how Pweave works on my
[blog](https://aliceriot.github.io/2015/08/11/literate-programming-in-python.html).
